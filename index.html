            <h2>Welcome Message</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Joseph Njeri — a passionate Data Scientist and Full-Stack Developer blending advanced analytics
                with modern web development. With expertise in machine learning, Django, Flask, React, and PostgreSQL, I
                build intelligent applications that transform data into actionable insights. I believe the future of
                technology lies in the fusion of AI and full-stack development — and the sooner you get on board, the
                better. Explore my projects to see how I turn ideas into impactful solutions, from investment apps to
                interactive web designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s create something extraordinary together
            </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Joseph Njeri and I am a full stack software developer and data scientist. My background combines
                machine learning, data engineering, and modern web development, allowing me to create complete
                end-to-end solutions that bring together powerful back-end intelligence and responsive, user-friendly
                front-end design.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, my profession hasn't always been in Tech. My academic background is in atmospheric science. I
                hold
                a Doctor of Natural Sciences (Dr. rer. nat) in Atmospheric Physics and Dynamics from the Karlsruhe
                Institute
                of Technology (2015–2019), where I researched the diagnosis and simulation of extreme precipitation
                events
                over Kenya. Before that, I earned a Master of Science in Meteorology from the University of Nairobi
                (2010–2012), focusing on assessing the predictability of rainfall using tropical convection indices, and
                a
                Bachelor of Science in Meteorology from the same institution (2005–2009).
            </p>
            <p>
                I have professional experience in predictive modeling, recommender systems, image recognition, and
                financial modeling using Python, Keras, and scikit-learn. On the backend, I work with Django REST
                Framework and Flask to build APIs and data-driven applications, while also drawing on a strong
                foundation in PostgreSQL and MongoDB. On the frontend, I am self-taught in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                React, continuously building responsive, interactive projects that showcase how design and functionality
                come together. Alongside this, I have also worked as a trainer and curriculum developer at neuefische
                GmbH,
                mentoring students and preparing them for industry roles.
                Some of my selected GitHub projects and ongoing work can be found <a id="my-projects"

            </p>
            <p>
                My core expertise lies in machine learning and AI, where I apply advanced methods using Python, Keras,
                and scikit-learn to build predictive models, recommender systems, and image recognition solutions. I
                have also developed robust data engineering workflows and designed APIs using Django REST Framework and
                Flask, with a strong foundation in PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
            </p>
            <p>
                I live in Karlsruhe, Germany, and I am always open to collaborations, research, or projects at the
                intersection of full stack software development and data science.
